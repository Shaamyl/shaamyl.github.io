		<h1>The Souls of Poor Folk</h1>
		<img src="images/titleimage.PNG">
		<p><a href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PPC-Audit-Full-410835a.pdf">The Souls of Poor Folk</a> is an empirical study that brings us toward an honest confrontation with our
			own history—how our path has unfolded since 1968 and how our nation trembles today for lack of
			moral vision. It summons our highest moral aspirations and diagnoses our deepest national ailments
			over five decades. It draws on academic research but also upon the testimonies of human beings
			battered by harmful public policies. Alongside the carefully assembled facts, you will hear the voices
			of America’s poor themselves, many of them now joining this movement. “Not everything that is faced
			can be changed,” James Baldwin reminds us, “But nothing can be changed until it is faced.”</p>
		<p>Key Findings:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Nearly 140 million people (43.5 percent) are either poor or low-income</li>
			<li>Legislative actions and legal decisions at the federal and state levels have severely
				restricted the ability of people of color, especially poor Black people, Latinx, and Native
				Americans, to participate in democratic processes.</li>
			<li>Militarism abroad has gone hand in hand with the militarization of U.S. borders and of
			poor communities across this country.</li>
